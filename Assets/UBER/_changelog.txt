1.2h

- U2019 adjusted (fixed local keywords issues)
- fixed broken shadow casters that uses ZWRITE variant (parallax with "Write into depth")

1.2g

- Fixed heightblending for 2layer shader variants (look for #define FIX_2LAYERS_INVERTION in UBER_StandardConfig.cginc to use old inverted logic)
- U2018 adjusted (Substance handling temporarily disabled)

1.2f

- fixed point light shadow casters error for DX11 in Unity2017.3 (using raw depth cube maps)

1.2e

- we can now select Albedo texture alpha channel as smoothness source
- added shader switch to invert diffuse scattering - works for core shader variants. Look for #define FAKE_RETROREFLECTION in core shaders. This feature can be useful to approximate road sign materials
- fixed compilation error (1.2d regression) for ForwardAdd variants
- fixed geom blend shaders compilation errors (1.2d regression)

1.2d

- fixed Unity 2017 shadowmask lightmap mode
- fixed depth pass missing in refraction/triplanar shader variant
- fixed snow/wetness applied on cutout materials where we've got clipped parts
- added queue and instancing controls to material inspector

1.2c

- fixed leaking glossiness from constant wetness
- Unity 5.6.1f1 (and up) fixed lightmapping

1.2b

- U5.6_beta10 tested
- fixed deferred translucency for VR
- fixed shadow bias for point lights when writing into depth

1.2 (U5.5 compatibility package)

- U5.5 (U5.5.0b6 submitted) compatibility
- 2x slimmed down shader count (no separate shader files for snow) from 152 to 76

1.1c

- LOD Group implementation. UBER shaders will now react to LOD fading
- cleanup/fixed instancing (prepared for usage, but turned off by default - uncomment #pragma multi_compile_instancing in choosen shaders to turn it on)

1.1b

- fixed directional specular lightmap decoding

1.1

- Unity 5.3 compatibility
- Translucency in deferred rebuilt for 4 independent setups
- glcore compatibility solved (tessellation on Macs)
- match Relief Terrain Pack (work flawless together)

1.04

- Unity 5.2 deferred reflections compatibility
- Translucency in deferred works in scene view
- new variants - 2 sided / 2 layers with layer selected by side
- albedo tinting by vertex RGB color can be optionally masked by albedo texture (A) channel

1.03

- fixed empty references to default textures for water&snow
- fixed issue  for additional light with water in forward
- fixed dynamic snow not working in DX9
- reduced wobbling issue in tessellation
- introduced optional tessellation displacement strength from vertex color
- new 2 sided variants
- improved translucency model
- fallback set to to Unity Standard Shader
- GGX specularity switch described


1.02
- openGL compatibility issues
- RAM consumption reduced (24x times...)
- compatible with Alloy
- dynamic weather features with controller
- new dissolve (cutoff) emission
- fixed a lot of bugs
